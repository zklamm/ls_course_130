# In our Ruby course content on blocks, we learn about "symbol to proc" and how
# it works. To review briefly, consider this code:

# comparator = proc { |a, b| b <=> a }
# and the Array#sort method, which expects a block argument to express how the
# Array will be sorted. If we want to use comparator to sort the Array, we have
# a problem: it is a proc, not a block. The following code:

# array.sort(comparator)
# fails with an ArgumentError. To get around this, we can use the proc to block
# operator & to convert comparator to a block:

# array.sort(&comparator)

# This now works as expected, and we sort the Array in reverse order.

# A lone & applied to an object causes ruby to try to convert the object to a
# block. If that object is a proc, the conversion happens automagically, just
# as shown above. If the object is not a proc, then & attempts to call the
# #to_proc method on the object first. Used with symbols, e.g., &:to_s, Ruby
# creates a proc that calls the #to_s method on a passed object, and then
# converts that proc to a block. This is the "symbol to proc" operation (though
# perhaps it should be called "symbol to block").

# Did you know that you can perform a similar trick with methods? You can apply
# the & operator to an object that contains a Method; in doing so, Ruby calls
# Method#to_proc.

# Using this information, together with the course page linked above, fill in
# the missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of integers
# to base 8. Use the comments for help in determining where to make your
# modifications, and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm" section for
# this exercise; it should prove useful.

def convert_to_base_8(n)
  n.to_s(8).to_i # replace these two method calls
end

# The correct type of argument must be used below
base8_proc = method(:convert_to_base_8).to_proc

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work. Replace `a_proc`
# with the correct object

p [8,10,12,14,16,33].map(&base8_proc)

# The expected return value of map on this number array should be:

# [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
