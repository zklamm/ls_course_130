# So far, we've used iterators often. You've seen the use of #each and #map
# used on various data structures, such as Arrays and Hashes. These methods
# make writing certain code a bit easier, at least when compared to a while or
# for loop. Yet, what we've seen thus far is only part of what is available.

# Whenever we use map or each on something like an Array, we're using something
# called "Internal Iteration". It's called that because the process and
# implementation of that iteration is hidden from us, and the process that
# allows us to progress through a collection is part of that hidden
# implementation.

# There's also "External Iteration". This is iteration that takes place at the
# behest of the user. Ruby gives us the option to use this type of iteration
# with the Enumerator class. For this exercise, lets take a bit of a tour of
# the capabilities of Enumerator. While we do that, let's make something
# interesting with it.

# In this exercise, your task is to create a new Enumerator object. When
# creating a new Enumerator, you may define what values are iterated upon.
# We'll want to create an Enumerator that can iterate over an infinite list of
# factorials. Once you make this new Enumerator, test it out by printing out
# the first 7 factorial values, starting with zero factorial.

# More specifically, print the first 7 factorials by using an "External
# Iterator". Once you have done so, reset your Enumerator. Finally, reprint
# those same 7 factorials using your Enumerator object as an "Internal
# Iterator".

# You can find almost everything you need for this exercise in the
# documentation for Enumerator. In particular, check out the ::new method; it
# should prove a good starting point for this exercise. Some further details
# about internal vs external iterators are mentioned at the start of that
# documentation, so make sure to read that section. Keep in mind that that
# section can be a bit dense; if you don't understand everything about it,
# that's ok.

# The wikipedia page on factorials may also be of some use.

# Two final hints:

# You'll only need 3 Enumerator methods to complete this exercise.
# An Enumerator also implements the Enumerable module. Keep this in mind, as it
# may make certain parts of this exercise easier to write.

fact = Enumerator.new do |y|
  a = 1
  b = 1
  count = 2
  loop do
    y << a
    a = b
    b = (1..count).reduce { |product, n| product * n }
    count += 1
  end
end

p fact.take(7)
