# Lets return to implementing existing core ruby methods to learn about blocks.

# The Enumerable#map method iterates over the members of a collection, using
# the associated block to perform some sort of operation on each collection
# member. The returned values from the block are then built up into an Array
# that is then returned to the caller. Note in particular that every time #map
# yields to the block, it obtains just one value. That value may be a complex
# value - it may even be another collection - but it is nevertheless just one
# value. Thus, #map returns an Array that has the same number of elements that
# the original collection had.

# Write a method called map that behaves similarly for Arrays. It should take
# an Array as an argument, and a block. It should return a new Array that
# contains the return values produced by the block for each element of the
# original Array.

# If the Array is empty, map should return an empty Array, regardless of how
# the block is defined.

# Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject,
# loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an
# argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or
# any other collection.

def map(ary)
  new_ary = []
  ary.each { |elem| new_ary << yield(elem) }
  new_ary
end

# Examples:

p map([1, 3, 6]) { |value| value**2 } == [1, 9, 36]
p map([]) { |value| true } == []
p map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| false } == [false, false, false, false]
p map(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) { |value| value.upcase } == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
p map([1, 3, 4]) { |value| (1..value).to_a } == [[1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
