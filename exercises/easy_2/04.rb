# The Enumerable#count method iterates over the members of a collection,
# passing each element to the associated block. It then returns the number of
# elements for which the block returns a truthy value.

# Write a method called count that behaves similarly for an arbitrarily long
# list of arguments. It should take 0 or more arguments and a block, and then
# return the total number of arguments for which the block returns true.

# If the argument list is empty, count should return 0.

# Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject,
# loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an
# argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or
# any other collection.

def count(*params)
  truths = 0
  params.each { |param| truths += 1 if yield(param) }
  truths
end

# Examples:

p count(1, 3, 6) { |value| value.odd? } == 2
p count(1, 3, 6) { |value| value.even? } == 1
p count(1, 3, 6) { |value| value > 6 } == 0
p count(1, 3, 6) { |value| true } == 3
p count() { |value| true } == 0
p count(1, 3, 6) { |value| value - 6 } == 3
