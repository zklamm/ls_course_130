# The Enumerable#each_with_index method iterates over the members of a
# collection, passing each element and its index to the associated block. The
# value returned by the block is not used. each_with_index returns a reference
# to the original collection.

# Write a method called each_with_index that behaves similarly for Arrays. It
# should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each
# element and an index number to the block. each_with_index should return a
# reference to the original Array.

# Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #inject, loop, for, while, or
# until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use
# any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

def each_with_index(ary)
  idx = 0
  ary.each do |elem|
    yield(elem, idx)
    idx += 1
  end
end

# Examples:

result = each_with_index([1, 3, 6]) do |value, index|
  puts "#{index} -> #{value**index}"
end

puts result == [1, 3, 6]

# should output:

# 0 -> 1
# 1 -> 3
# 2 -> 36
# true
