# Assume we have a Tree class that implements a binary tree.

class Tree
  include Enumerable

  def each
    'code'
  end
end

# A binary tree is just one of many forms of collections, such as Arrays,
# Hashes, Stacks, Sets, and more. All of these collection classes include the
# Enumerable module, which means they have access to an each method, as well as
# many other iterative methods such as map, reduce, select, and more.

# For this exercise, modify the Tree class to support the methods of
# Enumerable. You do not have to actually implement any methods -- just show
# the methods that you must provide.
